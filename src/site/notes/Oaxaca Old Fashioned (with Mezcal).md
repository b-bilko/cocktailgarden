## Description

The Oaxacan Old Fashioned (aka Mezcal Old Fashioned) is the perfect union of mezcal with tequila, agave and bitters. A must try for mezcal lovers!

0 serving(s)
## Ingredients

1 1/2 ounces tequila reposado 
1/2 ounce mezcal 
1 teaspoon agave syrup or honey 
3 dashes chocolate bitters (or substitute Angostura bitters) 
Large ice cube (make clear ice!) 
Orange peel, for garnish
## Method

Step. 1 Stir the tequila, mezcal, agave syrup, and bitters in a lowball glass. Add a large clear ice cube. 
Step. 2 Express the orange peel onto the glass by squeezing it to release the oils. Or if desired, flame the orange peel (taking fire precautions as necessary!): Cut a piece of orange peel in a 2-inch circle. Hold the peel about 2 inches from the cocktail glass and warm it with a lit match. Then, quickly squeeze the peel to express the oils, causing it to flame briefly as the oil hits the glass.
