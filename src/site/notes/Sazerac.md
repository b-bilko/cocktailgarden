## Description


## Ingredients

- 2.5 oz Rye
- sugar cube muddled in the mixing glass with 1 bar spoon of filtered water
- a solid 4-5 dashes of Peychaud’s bitters (must be Peychaud’s). With a Sazerac nothing else will do.
- absinthe mist in your rocks glass before straining the rye into the glass
## Method

Mix your 2.5 oz of Rye in your mixing glass with the muddled cube and bitters. Strain into your rocks glass (don’t forget the absinthe mist in the glass first), and it’s served up.
