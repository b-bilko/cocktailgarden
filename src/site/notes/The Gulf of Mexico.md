## Description

Did you know that the margarita is the most popular cocktail in America? Of course you can’t have a margarita without tequila (and a few other imported ingredients).

So to celebrate national Margarita day I came up with this spicy pineapple margarita made with some of America’s favorite ingredients, like tequila, limes, Tajin, and chili liqueur. I also made it blue to match the color of the water in Cancun, America’s favorite vacation destination!

One more fun fact ya! Did you know that agave spirits are the fastest growing category in America? Americans sure do love their Margaritas, Paloma’s, and Ranch Waters!

Here’s [the mini episode](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGYj06QPtE5/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==) for visual learners, and I also crack a few jokes
## Ingredients

2oz Mexican Tequila (Madre)

1oz lime juice

1/2oz Ancho Reyes verde chili liqueur

1/2oz pineapple syrup (liber & co)

Tajin to rim

Pinch of blue spirulina
## Method

To make the cocktail begin by rimming your glass with Tajin. I like to brush on a bit of syrup to really get the Tajin to stick on in a thick layer. Add the rest of the ingredients into a shaker with one large cube of ice, shake for about 10 seconds or until the spirulina is fully incorporated. Strain into your glass filled with nugget ice and garnish with a lime wheel
