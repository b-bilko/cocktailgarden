## Description

The classic whiskey sour gets a refreshing upgrade with vermouth, raspberries, egg white, and a nice high-proof bourbon.
## Ingredients

1.5 oz. high-proof bourbon 
0.5 oz. blanc vermouth (or “blanco” or “bianco”) 
0.75 oz. Simple Syrup 
0.75 oz. lemon juice 
3-4 fresh raspberries 
1 tsp. Campari 
1 egg white

## Method

Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker without ice. 
Seal the shaker, hold tight, and give it a “dry” shake without ice for three to five seconds. 
Then add ice, seal again, and shake for eight to 10 seconds. 
Fine strain into a coupe or cocktail glass, and garnish with a couple drops of Angostura bitters or a raspberry, on a pick.
