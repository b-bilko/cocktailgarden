## Description

The Paper Plane is a modern variation on the [Last Word](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-last-word/), a classic, equal-parts drink composed of gin, lime, maraschino liqueur and green Chartreuse. At first glance, the bourbon-spiked Paper Plane might not seem too similar. But it follows the same template and consists of equal parts bourbon, Amaro Nonino, Aperol and lemon juice. Both drinks strike a beautiful balance between bitter, sour and herbal notes.
