## Description

This Mezcal cocktail has a unique flavor profile that is at the same time smoky, spicy, tangy, a little sweet and totally refreshing.

2 ounce fresh lime juice 
2 ounce simple syrup 
2 squirts of Sriracha Ice, for the shaker and the glasses 
Salt, for the rim 
Chipotle chili powder (or other mild chili powder), for the rim and to sprinkle on the surface 
Lime wheels for garnish

## Method

Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice, add Mezcal, lime juice, simple syrup and sriracha, shake well and pour into iced glasses
Sprinkle a small pinch of chili powder over the surface of each drink, and hang a lime wheel on each rim
