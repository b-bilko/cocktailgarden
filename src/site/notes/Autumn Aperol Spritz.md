## Description

The drink weaves together all of the components of the classic cocktail, but leans on cider, apples, and a few warm spices to make it appropriate for this season.
## Ingredients

2 oz aperol
2.5 oz apple juice
Top with Prosecco (looked like about 1-2 Oz
## Method

First, make the ice cubes. Add diced apples, cinnamon sticks, and star anise to a large ice tray. Then pour water into them to cover, and put the tray in the freezer.

Garnish the rim of a cocktail glass with simple syrup, sugar, cinnamon, and edible glitter. To assemble the drink, add the spiced ice cube, then pour in Aperol and apple cider, and top it with Prosecco.
