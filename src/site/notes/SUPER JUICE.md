## Method

Step. 1 Peel the citrus of choice, weigh the peels, and put them in a jar with the appropriate amount of citric (and malic, for lime and orange) acid. See the formula above. 
Step. 2 Shake well and leave it for up to two hours. This will give you “oleo citrate” which will give our juice acidity and citrus flavor. 
Step. 3 Then place everything from the jar (including the peels) into a blender and add water (again see formula above). 
Step. 4 Make sure to rinse inside of a jar with water to get out all the oleo citrate. Step. 5 Juice the lime/lemon / orange and add the juice into the blender as well. Step. 6 Blend for half a minute then strain through a cheesecloth. 1
Step. 7 Bottle the Super Juice, keep it in the fridge and use it within a week.
