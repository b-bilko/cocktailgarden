## Description

Delicious flavored vodka that's not overly sweet and has just the right amount of vanilla flavor.
## Ingredients

- 12 ounces vodka
- 1 [vanilla bean](https://amzn.to/3QKPdZV)

### Instructions

- Cut the vanilla bean in half so that it will be completely covered by the vodka.
    
- Place the 2 halves of the vanilla bean in the bottle. Carefully pour 12 ounces of vodka into the bottle.
    
- Seal the bottle and give it a nice shake. Store in a cool, dark place and shake every 1-2 days. After 14 days your homemade vanilla vodka will be ready to enjoy. Strain the vanilla beans from the vodka and store the vodka in the sealable glass bottle.

## ### Notes

- This is a small batch recipe. If you want to make more, use a full bottle of vodka and 2 vanilla beans. 
- After 12-14 days, remove the vanilla beans from the vodka or you will end up with vanilla extract. Don't throw the beans away, you can still use them for baking!
