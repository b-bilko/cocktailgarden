## Description
Although most Americans think of eggnog as something they get out of a milk carton during the two-week period leading up to December 25, eggnog actually descends from sack posset, a strong, thick English beverage built upon eggs, milk, and either a fortified wine (like Madeira) or ale.

Add depth and complexity to this classic Christmas cocktail by using a mix of spirits and allowing it to age.

**Yield: 8 to 10 servings**
## Ingredients

- 600 grams eggs, pasteurized if you need peace of mind
- 454 grams sugar
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 480 milliliters half-and-half
- 473 milliliters whole milk
- 480 milliliters heavy cream
- 237 milliliters Jamaican rum
- 237 milliliters cognac
- 237 milliliters bourbon
- 0.3 teaspoon kosher salt
## Method
- Separate the eggs and store the whites for another application.
    
- Beat the yolks with the sugar and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl until the mixture lightens in color and falls off the whisk in a solid ribbon.
    
- Combine dairy, booze, and salt in a second bowl or pitcher and then slowly beat into the egg mixture.
    
- Move to a large glass jar (or a couple of smaller ones) and store in the fridge for a minimum of 2 weeks. A month would be better, and 2 better still. In fact, there’s nothing that says you couldn’t age it a year, but I’ve just never been able to wait that long. And yes, you can also drink it right away.
    
- Serve in mugs or cups topped with a little extra nutmeg grated on top.
