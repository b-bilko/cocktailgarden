## Description

I made this garnish yesterday and felt like it belonged on a Paper Plane riff, and the Last Flight was on my list to try. It was created in 2018 by Callum Rixson at Hideout in Bath, England (per Difford’s Guide). Overall it drinks a lot like a Paper Plane (no surprise there), but with a pretty pronounced anise/licorice flavor that cuts through from the green chartreuse on the finish and feels a little out of place. I’d be interested to try it with an absinthe rinse to lean into making the anise and some of the other herbal notes more of a focal point. It was tasty, but doesn’t compare to a Paper Plane imo.
## Ingredients
- 3/4oz Bourbon
- 3/4oz Aperol
- 3/4oz Green Chartreuse
- 3/4oz Lemon Juice
- Lemon Peel Garnish

## Method

Add ingredients to a sharing tin, shake with ice, and double strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon peel.
