## Description

One of the best and most popular drinks to come out of the 1980s. This drink shines with Chambord, and doesnâ€™t need any additional sugar syrup when made with the black raspberry liqueur. Why? Apart from being infused with raspberries and blackberries, Chambord also includes Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel and honey so it has an aromatic sweetness all on its own. Drizzle over the top carefully for that eye-catching bleed.
## Ingredients

30ml Gin
30ml Chambord
30ml lemon juice. 
## Method

Pour 30ml gin and 30ml lemon into a tumbler over crushed ice and stir / swizzle. Top with more crushed ice and compact ice to form a volcano-shaped mound. Drizzle 30ml of Chambord over the top to create a 'bleeding' effect in the glass.
