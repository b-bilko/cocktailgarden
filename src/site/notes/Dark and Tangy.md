## Description


## Ingredients

- 4cl dark jamaican rum (A split of Appleton Estate and Worthy Park 109)
- 1cl Coffee liqueur (Kask, similar to Mr.Black)
- 1cl Créme de cassis (Cartron)
- 0,5cl Muscovado syrup
- 2,5cl lemon juice
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Garnish with a lemon peel
## Method

The cocktail is shaken with all ingredients and strained into a chilled coupe. Express oils and garnish with a lemon peel.

**Scent:**  
First you get freshness of the lemon juice on the nose and some rich cola notes. There’s also a hint of coffee.

**Mouthfeel:**  
I honestly expected a heavier, more sugary mouthfeel, but it’s quite light.

**Taste:**  
You get the tartness of the lemon juice and the dark fruit of the cassis. The rum provides a well needed kick and deep cola flavour. Use a combination of rums that you like, but I like the Jamaican funk, and Worthy Park 109 was very good, but I could see Smith and Cross being equally good or better. But do use a rum with higher abv. The coffee liqueur comes in mostly in the finish, but it also provides some complexity. I hope you give it a shot!
