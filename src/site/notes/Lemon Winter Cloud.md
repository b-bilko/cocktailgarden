## Ingredients

60mL · 2oz Limoncello 
7.5mL · 0.25oz Lemon Juice 
70g Water 
30mL · 1oz Honey Syrup 
2 drops 20% Saline Solution 
1mL Sichuan Peppercorn Tincture 
1 egg
## Method

Add everything to a saucepan, place it on medium-low heat and whisk constantly as you heat it up slowly. Once you see it fluff up nicely and there’s steam coming out, it should be at the right consistently, so turn off the heat and pour it quickly into a cup or a double-walled glass. Start enjoying it as soon as possible, while it’s still rich & fluffy. Cheers!
