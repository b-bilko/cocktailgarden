## Description


## Ingredients

● 45mL · 1.5oz Limoncello, Limecello or Orancello 
● 30mL · 1oz Magenta Blanco Tequila 
● 22.5mL · 0.75oz Lime Super Juice
● 2 drops 20% Saline Solution

## Method

So the start is the same for all three: 
chill the shaker then add the first ingredient. All three cocktails also get saline solution, because salt enhances all flavors, and you can’t have a Margarita twist without salt. Then add plenty of ice for each of the cocktails, seal the shakers, and get two friends to help you shake the cocktails… that’s what friends are for, right? Then double strain the cocktails into chilled coupe glasses, express essential oils from lemon, orange, and lime for the appropriate Margaricello, drop it in the cocktails, and let’s give them a try.
