## Description
mead sour cocktail recipe
A good dry traditional mead is quite versatile when it comes to making a solid cocktail, though you need to give it a taste to see what flavors it will best pair with. The HoneyMaker Dry Mead has a fruity profile with prominent peach and citrus notes – which made me decide to make a “sour” cocktail.

To keep the citrus throughout, I’m using Gran Gala Liqueur, a  brandy-based orange liqueur from Italy. If you don’t have this (or Grand Marnier) feel free to try it with triple-sec as a substitute.

This cocktail could be one of my favorite mead cocktails I’ve made. It has a lot going for it. It’s sour, sweet, and boozy. Give it a shot and let me know what you think!
