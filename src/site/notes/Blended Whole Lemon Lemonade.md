## Description


## Ingredients

3 thin-skinned lemons (3 to 3 1/2 ounces each) 
1 cup sugar 
4 cups cold water, divided
Ice, for serving

## Method

Step. 1 Wash the lemons to remove any waxy coating. Trim the hard stem end; cut the lemons into quarters and remove the seeds. Cut the quarters into large chunks. Add to blender. 
Step. 2 If your lemon has thicker skin, or if the blossom end is thick, trim it to reduce bitterness. 
Step. 3 Add the sugar and 3 cups water to the carafe of a blender. Blend on high until smooth, about 30 seconds. 
Step. 4 Strain the lemonade over a pitcher using a fine-mesh sieve. Use a silicone spatula to press the pulp against the strainer and wring out the remaining juice. You could discard the pulp if youâ€™d like.
Step. 5 Add the remaining 1 cup of water and stir to combine. Serve lemonade over ice.
