## Description


A Gin Sour sweetened with orange liqueur. Harry Craddock's original 1930 recipe calls for 1 part lemon, 1 part triple sec, and 2 parts gin. Depending on your lemons, this tends to produce an overly sour cocktail, hence I've reduced the citrus and added a touch of sugar. 


Adapted from a recipe in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book. FINE AND DANDY COCKTAIL. ¼ Lemon Juice. ¼ Cointreau. ½ Plymouth Gin. 1 Dash Angostura Bitters. Shake well and strain into cocktail glass. Harry Craddock, The Savoy Cocktail Book, 1930

22.5 ml L'Original Combier Triple Sec Liqueur

1 dash Angostura Aromatic Bitters
