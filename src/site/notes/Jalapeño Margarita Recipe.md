## Description


## Ingredients




2 oz Manik Reposado Tequila

3/4 oz Lâ€™Unique Cointreau

1 Barspoon of Agave Syrup

1/2 fresh like juice

## Method

Rim glass with lime juice, then rim with Tajin (or spicy salt of your choice) and set aside

Muddle 3 Fresh (or Pickled if you like, makes a different flavor) JalapeÃ±o Slices, with 1/2 oz Fresh Lime Juice

[Note: Remove seeds if you are weak ðŸ˜ˆ]


Add to shaker with large cubes, shake for 20 seconds. Double into glass. Garnish with lime.

The advice was to use a better Triple Sec, and I have to say it is better. The drink is less sweet, has a nice bite, alongside some darker sugar notes. Thanks yâ€™all!
