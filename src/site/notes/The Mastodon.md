## Description

The Mastodon, invented by San Francisco bartender Alex Smith presumably during his time at Smuggler’s Cove, is typically served in a hallowed out pineapple. At home, any larger format glass works. I used a Belgian tulip beer glass for this:
## Ingredients

1.5 oz (50 mL) rum (Appleton Signature) 
1.5 oz (50 mL) bourbon (Bulleit)
0.5 oz (15 mL) maraschino liqueur (Luxardo) 
1 oz (30 mL) Chinola passionfruit liqueur 
0.5 oz (30 mL) Licor 43 
2 dashes Peychaud’s bitters 
3 oz (90 mL) pineapple juice 
0.5 oz (15 mL) lime juice
## Method

Shake well with ice and open pour over crushed ice into glass. I garnished mine with a lime wedge and colorful umbrella to really capture the vibe :)
